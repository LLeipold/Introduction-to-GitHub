# **Introduction-to-GitHub**

### Purpose
This repository was created as part of a lab for a geospatial analysis class. My goal in creating this respository is to learn how GitHub works (the basics), how to upload/publish data, and to familiarize myself with Markdown. 

### Data Set
Within this repository, I have uploaded a ficticious dataset that is describing the result of a survey asking participants for their first name, age, Country, job title, and number of children. The ficticious dataset was created using Mackaroo - Random Data Generator at mackaroo.com
